## **Domain**

**Domain: Gravity of Black Incarceration in Reference of Other Races**

Although analyzing every hidden corner of inequality in this dataset
would be ideal, it's so much data that it can support thousands of
research reports. I decided to focus in on identifying the _gravity
black incarceration in reference of other races_ included in the data.
With 2020's protests bringing worldwide attention to black inequality
in all aspects of our society, I hope to contribute to this discussion
through general and comparative analysis. Additionally, black
incarceration has been an intense point of discussion throughout
the U.S.'s history.

## **Variables**

**Variables Chosen to Analyze:**

**Variable Set 1:** Between all states, how many, when, and where the **most** incarcerated **black**
populations reside:
 - _Black: 13143.92 (hundreds), 1993, CA, Los Angeles County_
 - I chose to analyze this variable to give me a general idea of the scale I
 would be working with going forward. Starting off with the black incarcerated population since it's
 my domain of interest.


**Variable Set 2:** Between all states, how many, when, and where the **most** incarcerated **white**
populations reside:
 - _White: 7036.59 (hundreds), 1993, CA, Los Angeles County_
 - Again, I chose to analyze this variable to give me an idea of the population scale.
 Second is the white incarcerated population because based off of my own experiences,
 there are an incredible amount of incarceration discussions revolving around black vs. white populations.

**Variable Set 3:** Both the ratios for the highest single incarcerated **black** and **white**
populations to each respective year's total population
(both ended up being 1993 in CA, Los Angeles County, which allows for an
equivalent ratio comparison). Additionally, ratio of incarcerated black to white
populations:
 - _Black/Total - 0.5600977_
 - _White/Total - 0.299848_
 - _Black/White: 1.867939_
 - I chose these variables to put into perspective the ratio difference between
 black and white incarcerated populations. This gave already started me off in
 identifying the 'gravity' of black incarceration by comparing multiplicity.

**Variable Set 4:** Between all states, how many, when, and where the **most**
incarcerated **AAPI**, **latinx**, **native**, and **'other race'** populations reside
 - _AAPI: 893 (hundreds), 1993, CA, Los Angeles County_
 - _Latinx: 16594.81 (hundreds), 1993, CA, Los Angeles County_
 - _Native: 425 (hundreds), 2007, CA, Los Angeles County_
 - _'Other Race': 1642 (hundreds), 2002, IN, Marion County_
 - I chose these variables to further my understanding of the gravity of
 black incarceration in comparison to other races. Additionally, this allowed
 me to identify location trends (CA, Los Angeles County is significant).

**Variable Set 5:** In the most recent year, the highest single population
for incarcerated **black**, **white**, **AAPI**, **latinx**, and **'other race'** individuals
across all states
 - _Black: 5024 (hundreds)_
 - _White: 4577 (hundreds)_
 - _AAPI: 286.4 (hundreds)_
 - _Latinx: 8728 (hundreds)_
 - _Native: 379 (hundreds)_
 - _'Other Race': 608 (hundreds)_
 - I chose these variables to apply my thoughts so far to modern day (2018, the most recent year data) and check
 if my initial analysis was applicable over time. Generally, it did and it
 helped me decide on relevant graph analyses.

**Summary Information**

**Variable Set 1** showed an incredibly high maximum population for a single
black incarcerated population in CA in 1993. This ultimately pales in comparison
to the white incarcerated population shown in **Variable Set 2** for the same
location and time, with it being almost _half_ of the black incarcerated population.
**Variable Set 3** further highlights this point, showing that the black
incarcerated population maximum compared to the white incarcerated population
maximum is specifically around 1.8x as much. Additionally, the black incarcerated
population makes up around 56% of the total population for that year. **Variable Set 4**
identifies the same information for all other listed races, showing there is a
significant amount of incarcerations in CA, Los Angeles County. Furthermore,
going against my assumptions and showing that the latinx incarcerated population
has the highest maximum out of any race. **Variable Set 5** finalizes analysis
of the maximum values by comparing the incarcerated population values between
all races in modern day. It confirms that the black and latinx incarcerated
populations are still the two highest values, with the gravity being visualized
in the attached graphs.

## Graph Rationale - Also Found in Index HTML

## Graph 1 - Trends Over Time: Bar chart comparing the 10 highest incarcerated populations over time for each race (by year)

I included this bar chart to visualize the maximum incarcerated population analysis I
conducted in my variable analysis. Although I had to keep it to the 10 highest
values due to the limitations of the project, it still shows incredibly interesting
trends. A bar chart was chosen to visually and easily identify skews in the data
alongside it being a user-friendly visualization for the comparison of multiple values. These
particular points can be made:
- The the maximums for all other populations other than
black and latinx never reach the lowest maximum for these two populations.
- There is a peak in maximum incarcerated population around 1993 (it's skewed
towards 1993).
 - Given this, the 21st century has lower maximums overall than recorded incarcerated
 population values in the late-20th century.
- Black and latinx incarcerated populations have the two highest sets of maximums
and largely overlap at the same time period (at the skewed point around 1993).

## Graph 2 - Variable Comparison Chart: Boxplots of the 10 highest incarcerated black populations and the total incarcerated populations for each of their respective years.

I included this chart to focus in on the gravity of historically high (the 10 highest) black
incarcerated populations, adding perspective to its gravity in comparison to other races (Graph 1).
By comparing with the total population, it can give us a better visualization of how
large the black incarcerated population really is. A boxplot was chosen to reveal
where the general percentiles and medians lie for both populations to better summarize and
formulate conclusions on these two variables. The boxplot is especially powerful when
outliers need to be considered as well, which after looking at the maximums, is
a necessity. This graph shows:
- The median of the black incarcerated population is around 1/4 of the
total incarcerated population's median.
- The high outlier for the black incarcerated population is a little
less than half of the incarcerated population's high outlier.
- The black incarcerated population's 50th percentile is _heavily_ skewed more towards
its 25th percentile while the total population is _slightly_ skewed in the same direction.

Conclusively, these boxplots show us that the black incarcerated population,
throughout its historic highs, have constituted a **significant** portion of the
total incarcerated population for their respective years. There's no doubt that
the black incarcerated population represents significant inequality compared to
other races (other than latinx which we identified in the previous graph).

## Graph 3 - Map: Density of the Total Black Incarcerated Population by County 

I decided to focus on visualizing the density of the total black incarcerated population by county to identify general, prominent key areas. I chose counties instead of states because based on my previous analysis, the highest incarcerated black populations are condensed into a select number of counties, not states as a whole. The map is powerful in that it shows how heavily skewed some individual counties are despite their relative size to lower black incarcerated population counties. In the map, blue represents lower populations, while a gradient increasing to a bright red (highest population) represents higher populations. Gray areas represent no data. The map shows:

- Prominent, high black incarcerated populations reside within the southwest, southeast, and east areas of the U.S.
- The collection of data is skewed to the east of the U.S., while there is less data collected from the central to west of the U.S.
- Central U.S. consistently has blue, meaning its counties' general black incarcerated populations are relatively lower.
